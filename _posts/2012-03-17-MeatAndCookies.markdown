    These images were an homage project to the photographer Andres Serrano and his piece Milk and Blood. 
    His image is two panels, one completely red and one completly white. 
    They are each photographs of giant vats of blood and milk. 
    My piece takes the theme of blood and milk, but juxtaposes them with food they are not normally associated with. 
    The bloody raw steak is posed with a glass of milk, while the cookies are posed with a glass of wine, or quite possibly, blood.
